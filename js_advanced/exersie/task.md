# Exercise for the sessions

## Task 1

write a program to print even numbers from 0 to 100 
    number/2 == 0 then even 

Improvise the above program for its performance 

    for( ) -> 100 itteration 

    let arr = [0...100]
    arr.foreach(element => (element%2===0) ) -> higer order method 100 -> other cores 

    for(i=0;i<100; i+2) -> 50 itteration
